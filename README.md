# Farquaads Last Chance Game in Javascript

This game is a representation of the classic arcade game Donkey Kong. The roles are reversed as you play as Lord Farquaad and climb the platforms while you try to dodge the obstacles thrown at you as you try to rescue princess Fiona from the hands of Shrek. You decide does Lord Farquaad gets the princess this time?
